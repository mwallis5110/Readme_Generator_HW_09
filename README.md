## Installation Instructions
In order to initialize the program, users should open it in an integrated terminal and type "node index.js". The prompts for the ReadMe document will then appear in sequential order to be filled out by the user. Please note, the program requires Node.js and inquirer.js to run.

## Using the Program
After initializing the program, users will be prompted to input their content with the command line. Pressing enter will cause the program to move to the next prompt. When all prompts are completed, the finished ReadMe should appear in the main project directory.
